If you arrived at this repository via the HVC2017 paper "A Supervisory Control Algorithm Based on Property-Directed Reachability", checkout the branch HVC2017. That branch contains a snapshot of the code as it was at the time of writing the paper, while the master branch may or may not have been updated since. The HVC2017 branch also contains the problems used in the empirical evaluation, as well as a set of instructions for how to replicate that evaluation on your own machine.
